2 Different structures:
	-GANs(Generative Adversarial Networks)
		-Quality output
		-No explicit labels
		-HArder to program and train, more complex
	-CNN(convolutional neural Network)
		-Easier to train
		-Local features, not so much long-term coherence
	Start with CNN -> GANs?

Librosa for labeling, Splitting up dj sets?

Unsupervised Learning 
	-similar-sounding audio without explicit segmentation
	-Possibly no structure
Implicit labels
	-Time segmentation, sliding window, cluster for soft labeling
Label
	-Possibly label small portion for fine tuning

Spleeter
	-possibly split into stems
